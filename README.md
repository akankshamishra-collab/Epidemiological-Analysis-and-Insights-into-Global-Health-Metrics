# Epidemiological-Analysis-and-Insights-into-Global-Health-Metrics
  
This repository contains a Python notebook that offers an in-depth epidemiological analysis, providing insights into global health metrics.

**How to Use the Notebook:**

1. **Setup:**  
   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using pip:  
     `pip install jupyter`
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Datasets:**  
   The analysis leverages several datasets, including:
   - Life Expectancy across countries.
   - Birth rates.
   - Death rates and specific causes.
   - Population growth rates.
   - Exposure to various health risks.
   - Economic indicators like GDP.
   - Historical events and their impact on health metrics.

   Ensure all datasets are in the same directory as the notebook or adjust the file paths in the code accordingly.

   **Note that the original dataset was taken from mortality.org (The most comprehensive source of scientific data on death in industrialized nations is the Human death Database (HMD). Researchers, students, journalists, policy analysts, and others with an interest in human lifespan can use the HMD's extensive, high-quality harmonized mortality and population figures. The HMD adheres to open data standards.)**

4. **Running the Notebook:**  
   - Navigate to the directory containing the notebook using the command line.
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook by typing `jupyter notebook`.
   - Once Jupyter opens in your browser, click on the notebook file to open it.
   - Run each cell in sequence. Cells can be run by selecting them and clicking the 'Run' button or pressing Shift+Enter.

5. **Analysis Overview:**  
   The notebook starts with basic data exploration, providing visualizations for life expectancy estimations across countries. It delves into factors influencing population growth, such as birth and death rates, and provides a hypothetical exploration of the correlation between pollution levels and population size.

6. **Customization:**  
   - The notebook is modular, allowing users to focus on specific sections of interest.
   - For specific country analysis or to focus on a particular year, adjust the data filtering parameters as needed.

7. **Visualization:**  
   The notebook employs libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations. Ensure these libraries are installed or install them using pip:
pip install matplotlib seaborn
   

8. **Conclusion:**  
   After running the entire notebook, you'll gain comprehensive insights into global health metrics, understanding the various factors at play.

**Feedback & Contribution:**  
Your feedback is invaluable. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please raise an issue on GitHub. Contributions to enhance the analysis or improve visualizations are always welcome. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
